# Flights Data Analysis Case Study

Welcome to the Flights Data Analysis Case Study repository! This case study analyzes a flight dataset using SQL queries to gain insights into various aspects of flight operations and pricing.

## Case Study Overview

In this case study, we analyze a flight dataset containing flight dates, times, durations, prices, airlines, and routes. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights from the data using SQL queries.

## Dataset Description

The flight dataset consists of the following columns:
- `Date_of_journey`: Date of the flight journey.
- `Dep_Time`: Departure time of the flight.
- `Arrival_Time`: Arrival time of the flight.
- `Duration`: Duration of the flight.
- `Airline`: Airline operating the flight.
- `Source`: Departure city.
- `Destination`: Destination city.
- `Total_Stops`: Number of stops during the flight.
- `Price`: Ticket price.

## Case Study Objectives

The objectives of this case study include:
- Analyzing flight frequencies by month and day of the week.
- Calculating average prices by day of the week and airline.
- Identifying airlines with the longest flight durations.
- Analyzing flight durations and prices by source-destination pairs.
- Identifying flights with non-stop journeys and durations exceeding arrival times.
